    "The evaluation results for the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system indicate a strong performance overall.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Retrieval Quality: Achieved a high average score (0.98), indicating excellent retrieval accuracy from the vector database.\n",
    "- Answer Correctness: With an average score of 0.94, generated answers generally matched expected responses accurately, with occasional over-detailing.\n",
    "- Hallucination Detection: Scored relatively low (0.3), suggesting minimal hallucination occurrences. However, there's room for improvement to reduce minor irrelevant details.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Important Hyperparameters**\n",
    "Several hyperparameters proved particularly important for the RAG system:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `TEMPERATURE`:\n",
    "  - Crucial for controlling randomness. A lower value (close to 0) produced more deterministic and accurate responses, significantly reducing hallucinations.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `MAX_NEW_TOKENS`:\n",
    "  - Vital for ensuring comprehensive answers without truncation. Setting this parameter to 1000 ensured sufficient detail without compromising clarity.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `REPETITION_PENALTY`:\n",
    "  - Important for improving readability and reducing repetitive content. The value of 1.2 provided a good balance between coherence and variability.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `WatsonxEmbeddings:\n",
    "  - Using a multilingual embedding model (\"ibm/granite-embedding-278m-multilingual\") significantly improved retrieval accuracy, particularly beneficial when handling diverse content.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Vector Search Parameter (`k`):\n",
    "  - Choosing the right number of retrieved documents (`k=3`) was critical, balancing context relevance with computational efficiency and avoiding information overload in the generated answers.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Recommendations for Further Improvement**\n",
    "- Experimenting further with the temperature could potentially reduce hallucination further.\n",
    "- Adjusting the `k` value dynamically based on question complexity might optimize retrieval precision and response accuracy.\n"
