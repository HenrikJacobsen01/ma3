    "\n",
    "Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) is a powerful technique that enhances [language models](/docs/concepts/chat_models/) by combining them with external knowledge bases. RAG is a technique used to address [a key limitation of models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11817): Generative language models rely on fixed training datasets, which can lead to outdated or incomplete information - and they will likely not know the answer to domain-specific questions like confidential company information. When an LLM is presented with a query that it doesn't know the answer to, the best case scenario is that it will respond with \"I don't know.\" However, as generative models lack self-reflection and are trained to, well, generate, in many cases, the model will generate a response that is incorrect, irrelevant or directly misleading, a phenomenon known as *hallucinations*.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Understanding hallucinations\n",
    "Research (e.g., \"*[Hallucination is inevitable: An innate limitation of large language models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11817)\"* (2024) by Xu, Z., Jain, S., & Kankanhalli, M.) shows that hallucinatory behavior is a fundamental limitation of LLMs. As autoregressive models, they generate text sequentially with no mechanism to verify factual accuracy against reality. Their knowledge is fixed in parameters during training and lacks external grounding during generation. Mathematical proofs show that even theoretically perfect LLMs cannot learn all computable functions, making some degree of hallucination inevitable. This limitation applies not just in theoretical frameworks but extends to all real-world LLM applications as well. One dire example is [how a lawyer used ChatGPT in court and cited fake cases, leading to a judge considering sanctions.](https://www.forbes.com/sites/mollybohannon/2023/06/08/lawyer-used-chatgpt-in-court-and-cited-fake-cases-a-judge-is-considering-sanctions/?sh=3fd97317c7f3&ref=alhena.ai). When forced to find an answer outside its training data, the model simply invents one. \n",

    "> *\"I always struggle a bit with I'm asked about the \"hallucination problem\" in LLMs. Because, in some sense, hallucination is all LLMs do. They are dream machines. We direct their dreams with prompts. The prompts start the dream, and based on the LLM's hazy recollection of its training documents, most of the time the result goes someplace useful. It's only when the dreams go into deemed factually incorrect territory that we label it a \"hallucination\". It looks like a bug, but it's just the LLM doing what it always does.*\n",
    "\n",
    "> *At the other end of the extreme consider a search engine. It takes the prompt and just returns one of the most similar \"training documents\" it has in its database, verbatim. You could say that this search engine has a \"creativity problem\" - it will never respond with something new. An LLM is 100% dreaming and has the hallucination problem. A search engine is 0% dreaming and has the creativity problem. \\[...\\]\"*\n",
    "\n",
    "### Mitigating hallucinations\n",
    "While various approaches to mitigate hallucinatory behavior continue to develop, the underlying constraints ensure that some degree of hallucination will persist in any LLM implementation. When faced with a hallucinating model, we would like to feed it with more information. The intuitive way to accomplish this is to fine-tune the model on a specific dataset. However, this approach is costly and time-consuming, and it may not be feasible for all applications. And what if we have information that changes frequently, like news, product prices, or stock market data? Fine-tuning is not a practical solution in these cases because the model would need to be retrained every time the data changes. Broadly speaking, there are three ways to mitigate hallucinations:\n",
    "| Approach            | Pros                                                                 | Cons                                                                 |\n",
    "|---------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|\n",
    "| **Fine-tuning**     | Reduces hallucinations by training on specific datasets, Can improve model performance in specific domains | Costly and time-consuming, Not feasible for frequently changing information |\n",
    "| **Self-reflection** | Models can admit when they don't know the answer, Can reduce incorrect or misleading responses | Still in early stages of development, Might block hallucinations but doesn't expand the models knowledge. |\n",
    "| **External grounding** | Provides models with external knowledge sources to ground responses, Can significantly reduce hallucinations | Requires access to up-to-date and relevant knowledge bases, May involve additional complexity in system design and maintenance |\n",
    "\n",
    "### RAG as external grounding\n",
    "The inherent limitation of hallucinary behaviour highlights why complementary approaches like RAG have become popular. With RAG, we can induce the model with external knowledge *at inference time* instead of training time, a very cost effective alternative to fine-tuning. By grounding LLM responses in external, verifiable knowledge sources, RAG provides a practical technique to reduce hallucinations and (hopefully) improve the reliability of AI-generated content.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How does RAG work?\n",
    "When given a query, before the LLM sees the input, RAG systems first search a knowledge base for information relevant to the query (using semantic similarity search via a [retriever](/docs/concepts/retrievers/)). The system then incorporates this retrieved information into the model's prompt. This means that the model can use the provided context to generate a response to the query. What we are really doing is *grounding* the model's response in the retrieved context, which helps to reduce hallucinations and improve the quality of the response.\n",

      "My favorite breed of dog is the Golden Retriever, a large-sized gun dog originating from Scotland in the 19th century. They were initially bred for retrieving game such as waterfowl during hunting expeditions due to their exceptional intelligence, strength, and gentle temperament. Over time, they have become popular family pets because of these same qualities that make them excellent working dogs. Here are some reasons I adore this magnificent breed:\n",
      "\n",
      "1) Affectionate Nature: Golden Retrievers are known for being incredibly affectionate and loyal companions. They thrive on human interaction and form strong bonds with their families, often displaying unwavering devotion towards children and other animals alike. Their friendly demeanor makes them great choices for households where love and warmth are abundant.\n",
      "\n",
      "2) Intelligence & Trainability: Ranked among the most intelligent dog breeds by various canine experts, Goldens excel at learning new commands and tricks quickly. This trait not only enhances obedience training but also opens up opportunities for engaging activities like agility courses or therapy work. Moreover, their eagerness to please ensures smooth cooperation throughout any task.\n",
      "\n",
      "3) Versatility: Beyond companionship, Golden Retrievers possess remarkable versatility. Besides serving as service animals (guide dogs), search-and-rescue partners, and therapy dogs, they're equally comfortable participating in competitive sports including field trials, tracking tests, and dock diving events. Such diversity showcases their adaptability and physical prowess.\n",
      "\n",
      "4) Healthy Appearance & Longevity: With proper care, Golden Retrievers typically live between ten to twelve years - quite long compared to many larger breeds. Their dense double coat comes in shades ranging from light gold to dark cream, providing insulation against harsh weather conditions while requiring regular maintenance through brushing to prevent matting. Regular exercise keeps them fit both physically and mentally.\n",
      "\n",
      "5) Gentleness Towards Children: Given their patient nature and protective instincts, Golden Retrievers generally get along well with kids. Many even enjoy playing games involving tugging or fetching, fostering positive interactions between young ones and our four-legged friends. However, supervision remains crucial when introducing dogs into homes with infants or toddlers.\n",
      "\n",
      "In conclusion, my admiration for Golden Retrievers stems from their multifaceted abilities combined with an innately kind disposition. Whether you seek a dedicated friend, active partner, or helpful assistant, this breed consistently delivers joy, loyalty, and endless possibilities for shared experiences."

    "LangGraph is an extension of LangChain that allows you to build stateful, multi-actor systems using a graph-based structure. It's particularly useful for creating complex AI workflows where multiple components need to interact in a structured way. The typical pattern in LangGraph is to define nodes (functions or agents), the edges between them (which node should execute next), and conditions that determine the flow through the graph. This provides much more flexibility than linear chains while maintaining clear structure and control over the flow of information."
